# Dynasty Tag Hider

This userscript allows you to hide tags of your choosing, preventing them from being displayed on all chapter listings. Useful for avoiding spoilers.

## Usage

After the userscript has been installed, tags can be hidden/unhidden from the Tags page, accessible via the site Directory. Hovering over a tag should now display a show/hide toggle.

Currently only tags that appear on the Tags page can be hidden (i.e. not doujins or pairings). This functionality is planned for a future release.

## Changelog

1.0: Initial release.
